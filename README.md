- [**Babel Bot**](https://github.com/margostino/babel-bot): A conversational AI bot that interacts with users to capture, store, and retrieve memories.
- [**Babel Agent**](https://github.com/margostino/babel-agent): A daemon agent that syncs memory assets from local store to remote and keep index metadata up-to-date.
- [**Babel CLI**](https://github.com/margostino/babel-cli): A command-line interface for managing Babel data and interacting with the Babel data.
